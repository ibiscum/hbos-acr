# AudioControl

AudioControl is the next-generation audio control software for HiFiBerry devices, designed as the successor to [audiocontrol2](https://github.com/hifiberry/audiocontrol2). This Rust implementation offers improved performance, reliability, and a more modular architecture compared to its Python predecessor.

## Why a Rewrite?

As the original audiocontrol2 project grew in scope and complexity, it became increasingly difficult to maintain:

- The Python codebase suffered from runtime type errors and fragility in production
- Dynamic typing led to hard-to-diagnose issues that would often only appear at runtime
- The lack of strict interfaces made it challenging to ensure consistent behavior across different player implementations
- Concurrency issues and race conditions became more common as more features were added
- The plugin architecture, while flexible, became unwieldy as the number of plugins increased
- I wanted to learn Rust ;-)

This Rust implementation addresses these issues through strong static typing, a trait-based architecture, and better concurrency management, providing a more robust foundation for future development.

## Features

- Multi-player management with seamless switching between audio sources
- Unified interface for controlling different player backends (MPD, etc.)
- Event-based notification system for player state changes
- Clean separation between audio player control and user interfaces
- Last.fm integration for scrobbling and "now playing" updates
- Secure credential storage with AES-GCM encryption
- Lyrics support with LRC format parsing for synchronized lyrics (provider-based API for extensibility)
- SQLite database architecture for reliable caching and user settings storage

## TODO

- Additional lyrics providers (online services)

## Architecture

AudioControl/Rust uses a player controller abstraction to handle different audio player backends uniformly. The AudioController acts as a manager for multiple PlayerController instances and provides a unified interface for client applications.

## Configuration

AudioControl uses a JSON configuration file to define its behavior. The configuration file specifies settings for:

- Player backends (MPD, Librespot, etc.)
- API server settings
- Cache locations
- Plugin settings

### Configuration File Locations

AudioControl requires a valid configuration file to run. The configuration file is looked up in this order:

1. Path specified with the `-c` command line argument
2. `audiocontrol.json` in the current directory

When installed as a system service:

- The configuration file is located at `/etc/audiocontrol/audiocontrol.json`
- If this file doesn't exist during installation, it's automatically created from `/usr/share/hifiberry-audiocontrol/audiocontrol.json.sample`

### Cache Directories

AudioControl uses these paths for caching and persistent data:

- `/var/lib/audiocontrol/cache/attributes` - For metadata and other attributes (SQLite database)
- `/var/lib/audiocontrol/cache/images` - For image files like album covers
- `/var/lib/audiocontrol/db` - For user settings and configuration (SQLite database)

These paths are automatically created during installation with the correct permissions.

> **Note:** If you're manually editing the configuration file, always use absolute paths starting with `/` to avoid any path resolution issues.

### Directory Structure

When installed as a system service, AudioControl uses the following directory structure:

- `/etc/audiocontrol` - Configuration files location
  - `/etc/audiocontrol/audiocontrol.json` - Main configuration file
- `/var/lib/audiocontrol` - Variable data directory for runtime files and cache
  - `/var/lib/audiocontrol/cache/` - Cache directories for images and metadata
- `/usr/bin/audiocontrol` - The executable binary
- `/usr/share/hifiberry-audiocontrol/audiocontrol.json.sample` - Sample configuration file

Both `/etc/audiocontrol` and `/var/lib/audiocontrol` directories are owned by the `audiocontrol` user and group, which is automatically created during installation.

### Command Line Options

AudioControl supports the following command line options:

- `-c <path>`: Specifies the path to the configuration file
- `--debug`: Enables debug-level logging

## Genre Cleanup Bootstrap from MusicBrainz Dumps

You can generate a starter genre cleanup mapping without importing MusicBrainz into PostgreSQL.

The script streams `mbdump.tar.bz2` and `mbdump-derived.tar.bz2` directly from the MusicBrainz full export, aggregates official genre usage across entity tag tables, filters by a threshold, and maps to a compact base category set.

Run from the `acr` directory:

```bash
python3 scripts/generate_genre_base_from_mb_dumps.py \
  --threshold 200 \
  --output-json configs/genres.generated.base.json \
  --output-csv configs/genres.generated.counts.csv
```

Useful options:

- `--snapshot 20260228-002116` to pin an exact MusicBrainz export snapshot
- `--snapshot LATEST` (default) to use the newest snapshot
- `--max-rows-per-table N` for quick smoke tests

## Database Architecture

AudioControl uses SQLite for all persistent storage needs:

- **Attribute Cache** (`/var/lib/audiocontrol/cache/attributes/cache.db`) - Stores metadata and cached data from external services with in-memory optimization for high-performance operations
- **Settings Database** (`/var/lib/audiocontrol/db/settings.db`) - Stores user settings and configuration data

Both databases use SQLite for reliability, standards compliance, and excellent tooling support, while maintaining high performance through in-memory caching layers.
